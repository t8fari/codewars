# Playing with digits


def dig_pow(n, p):
    """
    Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

    89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1
    695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
    46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

    Given two positive integers n and p, we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n raised to consecutive powers starting from p is equal to k * n.

    In other words, writing the consecutive digits of n as a, b, c, d ..., is there an integer k such that :
    (ap+bp+1+cp+2+dp+3+...)=n*k(a^p + b^{p + 1} + c^{p + 2} + d^{p + 3} + ...) = n * k(ap+bp+1+cp+2+dp+3+...)=n*k

    If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

    Note: n and p will always be strictly positive integers.
    Examples:

    n = 89; p = 1 ---> 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1

    n = 92; p = 1 ---> -1 since there is no k such that 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k

    n = 695; p = 2 ---> 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

    n = 46288; p = 3 ---> 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
