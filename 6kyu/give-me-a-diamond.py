# Give me a diamond


def diamond(n):
    """
    You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

    Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.
    Examples

    A size 3 diamond:

    *
    ***
    *

    ...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"

    A size 5 diamond:

    *
    ***
    *****
    ***
    *

    ...that is:

    "  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n"
