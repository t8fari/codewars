def is_sorted_and_how(arr):
    """
    Complete the method which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

    "yes, ascending" - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending order
    "yes, descending" - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending order
    "no" - otherwise

    The order does not have to be strict: a sorted array can contain consecutive duplicates, e.g. [1, 1, 2, 3] is sorted in ascending order.

    It is guaranteed that there will always be a unique valid answer. More precisely:

    there will be no arrays with less than 2 elements
    there will be no arrays where all elements are equal
