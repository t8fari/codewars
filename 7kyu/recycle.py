# Recycle!


def recycle_me(rubbish):
    """
    You are having a BBQ, and after the BBQ you are left with some rubbish to recycle.

    There are 3 recycling boxes: Red: Plastic, Green: Glass, Blue: Card.

    You want to sort the rubbish according to the material and return the number of items in each box as an array (or a tuple in Python):

    [plastic, glass, card]

    The material type can be determined based on the sign of the item's value:

        Plastic: value > 0
        Glass: value < 0
        Card: value = 0

    Example

    rubbish = [5, -9, 0, 6, -84, -95, 15]
    // Plastic = 3, Glass = 3, Card = 1
    // Output: [3, 3, 1]
    """
    plastic, glass, card = 0, 0, 0
    for i in rubbish:
        if i>0:
            plastic += 1
        elif i<0:
            glass += 1
        else:
            card += 1
    return plastic, glass, card
